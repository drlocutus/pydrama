#
# Example application configuration file. Application wide definitions
# can be placed in this file.
#
# This file includes the file $(TOP)/config/CONFIG.Defs which is 
# created by the applSetup command. This contains some macros which
# override where files are installed, which target architectures should be
# built for, and where external application files should be looked for.
#
# The configuration variables currently supported in CONFIG.Defs are:
#
#   APPLIC_BASE: the name of the directory where UAE is installed. This is
#       normally the EPICS base directory.
#
#   APPLIC_CONFIG: The name of the directory when the configuration makefiles
#       are installed. This is normally $(APPLIC_BASE)/config
#
#   APPLIC_INSTALL: The installation directory for the application.
#
#   APPLIC_VERSION: the name of the directory in the installation directory
#	where the application bin, lib, include	(etc) directories are to be
#       installed. (It can be the dot directory).
#
#   APPLIC_TARGETS: the list of targets to build for (useful to build
#	for fewer targets than EPICS was built for). If not set, all
#	targets that EPICS was built for are built.
#
#   APPLIC_DEPENDS: the roots of the trees in which applications
#	that comprise the overall application have been installed.
#       $(EPICS_BASE) and $(EPICS_EXTENSIONS) are appended to this variable,
#       and it is then used to generate the include and library directories
#       for compiling and linking.
#
#   APPLIC_TEMPLATES: Path to the templates directory.
#
#   APPLIC_PWD_CMD: A script which will generate the absolute pathname
#       to the current working directory. Often the default of pwd
#       will suffice, but it sometimes has to be modified to circumvent
#       spurious paths generated by automounters.
#
#   The appropriate values for these variables are added to this file by the
#   applSetup.pl script.
